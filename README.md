### Features

- Aliases for all folders (components, styles, store etc.) see all available aliases in `./next-config.js`
- `antd` is added and configured to work well as an UI framework (css normalization is not need, antd has own)
- All folders in `./src` have own README.md file with a little documentation and usage guide
- `Helmet` implimented and configured, see an example in `./components/layouts/index.js`
